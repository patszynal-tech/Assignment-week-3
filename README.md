Using the datasets Iris and Plantgrowth, this is the code for my assignment for week 3. It answers the following questions.
1. Using the iris dataset...

  a. Make a histogram of the variable Sepal.Width.
  
  b. Based on the histogram from #1a, which would you expect to be higher, the mean or the median? Why?
  
  c. Confirm your answer to #1b by actually finding these values.
  
  d. Only 27% of the flowers have a Sepal.Width higher than ________ cm.
  
  e. Make scatterplots of each pair of the numerical variables in iris (There should be 6 pairs/plots).
  
  f. Based on #1e, which two variables appear to have the strongest relationship? And which two appear to have the weakest relationship?
  
2. Using the PlantGrowth dataset...

  a. Make a histogram of the variable weight with breakpoints (bin edges) at every 0.3 units, starting at 3.3.
  
  b. Make boxplots of weight separated by group in a single graph.
  
  c. Based on the boxplots in #2b, approximately what percentage of the "trt1" weights are below the minimum "trt2" weight?
  
  d. Find the exact percentage of the "trt1" weights that are below the minimum "trt2" weight.
  
  e. Only including plants with a weight above 5.5, make a barplot of the variable group. Make the barplot colorful using some color palette.
